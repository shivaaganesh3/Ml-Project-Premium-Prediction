# Methodology
**Data Preprocessing**
- Categorical variable encoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering for medical history and risk scoring

**Model Development**
- Separate models for different age groups to improve prediction accuracy
- Feature selection based on correlation analysis and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)
- Cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

**Evaluation Metrics**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared score
- Percentage difference between predicted and actual premiums

**Model Performance**
- The system employs specialized models:
- Young Adults Model (18â€“25): Achieved average prediction accuracy with error margins below 15%
- General Population Model (26+): Demonstrated strong performance with error margins typically around 10%
- Enhanced Models with Genetic Risk: Further improved prediction accuracy by incorporating genetic risk factors
